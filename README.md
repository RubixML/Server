# Rubix ML Server
Bring your [Rubix ML](https://github.com/RubixML/RubixML) models into production by serving them with one of our stand-alone model inference servers. Model severs wrap your trained estimator in an API that can be queried locally or over the network in real-time using standard protocols. They are optimized for low latency and scalability. In addition, the library provides client implementations that make querying models from your applications fast and easy.

## Installation

### Servers
Rubix model servers are stand-alone processes that wrap an estimator in an API that can be queried over a network connection. Since servers implements their own networking stack, they can be run directly from the PHP command line interface (CLI) without the need for an intermediary server such as Nginx or Apache. By utilizing concurrency, each server instance is able to handle thousands of connections at the same time. Need more inference throughput? Model servers scale by adding more instances behind a load balancer.

To boot up a server, pass a trained estimator instance to the `serve()` method:
```php
public function serve(Estimator $estimator) : void
```

```php
use Rubix\Server\HTTPServer;
use Rubix\ML\Classifiers\KNearestNeighbors;

$server = new HTTPServer('127.0.0.1', 8000);

$estimator = new KNearestNeighbors(5);

// Import a dataset

$estimator->train($dataset);

$server->serve($estimator);
```

Or, you can load a previously trained estimator from storage and serve it like in the example below.

```php
use Rubix\ML\PersistentModel;
use Rubix\ML\Persisters\Filesystem;

$estimator = PersistentModel::load(new Filesystem('example.model'));

$server->serve($estimator);
```

> **Note**: The server will stay running until the process is terminated. It is a good practice to use a process monitor such as [Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/) to start and autorestart the server in case of a failure.

#### Shutting Down The Server
To gracefully shut down the server, send a quit signal (`SIGQUIT`) to the process. To shut down immediately, without waiting for current connections to close, you can either send a terminate (`SIGTERM`) or interrupt (`SIGINT`) signal.

> **Note:** Signal handling does not work in Windows environments.

For example, to shut down gracefully, first identify the server's process ID (PID) and then send the `QUIT` signal to it.

```sh
$ kill -s QUIT 1234
```

#### Verbose Interface
Servers that implement the Verbose interface accept any PSR-3 compatible logger instance and begin logging critical information such as errors and start/stop events. To set a logger pass the PSR-3 logger instance to the `setLogger()` method on the server instance.

```php
use Rubix\ML\Other\Loggers\Screen;

$server->setLogger(new Screen());
```

### HTTP Server
A JSON over HTTP server exposing Representational State Transfer (REST) and GraphQL APIs. The HTTP Server operates with ubiquitous standards making it compatible with a wide range of systems. In addition, it provides its own web-based user interface for real-time server monitoring.

Interfaces: [Server](#servers), [Verbose](#verbose-interface)

#### Parameters
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | host | '127.0.0.1' | string | The host address to bind the server to. Use `'0.0.0.0'` to bind to all interfaces. |
| 2 | port | 8000 | int | The network port to run the HTTP services on. |
| 3 | cert | null | string | The path to the certificate used to authenticate and encrypt the HTTP channel. |
| 4 | middlewares | [] | array | The stack of server middleware to run on each request/response. |
| 5 | max concurrent requests | 20 | int | The maximum number of requests that can be handled concurrently. |
| 6 | sse reconnect buffer | 50 | int | The maximum number of events to store in the server-sent events (SSE) reconnect buffer. |

**Example**

```php
use Rubix\Server\HTTPServer;
use Rubix\Server\HTTP\Middleware\Server\AccessLogGenerator;
use Rubix\ML\Other\Loggers\Screen;
use Rubix\Server\HTTP\Middleware\Server\BasicAuthenticator;

$server = new HTTPServer('127.0.0.1', 443, '/cert.pem', [
	new AccessLogGenerator(new Screen()),
	new BasicAuthenticator([
		'morgan' => 'secret',
		'taylor' => 'secret',
	]),
], 100, 100);
```

#### Routes
The HTTP server exposes the following resources and their methods.

| Method | URI | Description |

### Server Middleware
HTTP middleware are processors of the incoming HTTP requests and outgoing responses produced by the request handler (or *Controller*). They allow the user to hook into the HTTP request/response cycle by inserting additional logic into the pipeline.

### Access Log Generator
Generates an HTTP access log using a format similar to the Apache log format.

#### Parameters
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | logger | | LoggerInterface | A PSR-3 logger instance. |

**Example**

```php
use Rubix\Server\HTTP\Middleware\Server\AccessLog;
use Rubix\ML\Other\Loggers\Screen;

$middleware = new AccessLog(new Screen());
```

```sh
[2020-11-04 23:10:57] INFO: 127.0.0.1 "POST /predictions HTTP/1.1" 200 140 - "Rubix ML REST Client/0.2.3"
[2020-11-04 23:11:54] INFO: 127.0.0.1 "POST /predictions/sample HTTP/1.1" 200 96 - "Rubix ML REST Client/0.2.3"
```

### Basic Authenticator
An implementation of HTTP Basic Auth as described in [RFC7617](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617).

> **Note:** This authorization strategy is only secure over an encrypted communication channel such as HTTPS with SSL or TLS.

#### Parameters
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | passwords | | array | An associative map from usernames to their passwords. |
| 2 | realm | 'auth' | string | The unique name given to the scope of permissions required for this server. |

**Example**

```php
use Rubix\Server\HTTP\Middleware\Server\BasicAuthenticator;

$middleware = new BasicAuthenticator([
	'morgan' => 'secret',
	'taylor' => 'secret',
], 'ml models');
```

### Shared Token Authenticator
Authenticates incoming requests using a shared key that is kept secret between the client and server. It uses the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` prefix to indicate the shared key.

> **Note:** This authorization strategy is only secure over an encrypted communication channel such as HTTPS with SSL or TLS.

#### Parameters
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | tokens | | array | The shared secret keys (bearer tokens) used to authorize requests. |
| 2 | realm | 'auth' | string | The unique name given to the scope of permissions required for this server. |

**Example**

```php
use Rubix\Server\HTTP\Middleware\Server\SharedTokenAuthenticator;

$middleware = new SharedTokenAuthenticator([
	'secret', 'another-secret',
], 'ml models');
```

### Trusted Clients
A whitelist of clients that can access the server - all other connections will be dropped.

#### Parameters
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ips | ['127.0.0.1'] | array | An array of trusted client ip addresses. |

**Example**

```php
use Rubix\Server\HTTP\Middleware\Server\TrustedClients;

$middleware = new TrustedClients([
	'127.0.0.1', '192.168.4.1', '45.63.67.15',
]);
```

---
### Clients
Clients allow you to communicate directly with a model server using a friendly object-oriented interface inside your PHP applications. Under the hood, clients handle all the networking communication and content negotiation for you so you can write programs *as if* the model was directly accessible in your applications.

Return the predictions from the model:
```php
public predict(Dataset $dataset) : array
```

```php
use Rubix\Server\RESTClient;

$client = new RESTClient('127.0.0.1', 8080);

// Import a dataset

$predictions = $client->predict($dataset);
```

Calculate the joint probabilities of each sample in a dataset:
```php
public proba(Dataset $dataset) : array
```

Calculate the anomaly scores of each sample in a dataset:
```php
public score(Dataset $dataset) : array
```

### Async Clients
Clients that implement the Async Client interface have asynchronous versions of all the standard client methods. All asynchronous methods return a [Promises/A+](https://promisesaplus.com/) object that resolves to the return value of the response. Promises allow you to perform other work while the request is processing or to execute multiple requests in parallel. Calling the `wait()` method on the promise will block until the promise is resolved and return the value.

```php
public predictAsync(Dataset $dataset) : Promise
```

```php
$promise = $client->predictAsync($dataset);

// Do something else

$predictions = $promise->wait();
```

Return a promise for the probabilities predicted by the model:
```php
public probaAsync(Dataset $dataset) : Promise
```

Return a promise for the anomaly scores predicted by the model:
```php
public scoreAsync(Dataset $dataset) : Promise
```

### REST Client
The REST Client communicates with the [HTTP Server](#http-server) through the JSON REST API it exposes.

Interfaces: [Client](#clients), [AsyncClient](#async-clients)

#### Parameters
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | host | '127.0.0.1' | string | The IP address or hostname of the server. |
| 2 | port | 8000 | int | The network port that the HTTP server is running on. |
| 3 | secure | false | bool | Should we use an encrypted HTTP channel (HTTPS)? |
| 4 | middlewares | | array | The stack of client middleware to run on each request/response.  |
| 5 | timeout | | float | The number of seconds to wait before giving up on the request. |
| 6 | verify SSL certificate | true | bool | Should we verify the server's SSL certificate? |

**Example**

```php
use Rubix\Server\RESTClient;
use Rubix\Server\HTTP\Middleware\Client\BasicAuthenticator;
use Rubix\Server\HTTP\Middleware\Client\CompressRequestBody;
use Rubix\Server\HTTP\Encoders\Gzip;

$client = new RESTClient('127.0.0.1', 443, true, [
	new BasicAuthenticator('user', 'password'),
	new CompressRequestBody(new Gzip(1)),
], 0.0, true);
```

### Client Middleware
Similarly to Server middleware, client middlewares are functions that hook into the request/response cycle but from the client end. Some of the server middlewares have accompanying client middleware such as [Basic Authenticator](#basic-authenticator) and [Shared Token Authenticator](#shared-token-authenticator).

### Basic Authenticator (Client Side)
Adds the necessary authorization headers to the request using the Basic scheme.

#### Parameters
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | username | | string | The username. |
| 2 | password | | string | The password. |

**Example**

```php
use Rubix\Server\HTTP\Middleware\Client\BasicAuthenticator;

$middleware = new BasicAuthenticator('morgan', 'secret');
```

### Compress Request Body
Apply a compression algorithm (*Encoder*) to the request body.

> **Note:** The request body must be larger than the standard max MTU (maximum transfer unit) otherwise the body will be sent uncompressed.

#### Parameters
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | encoder | Gzip | object | The encoder used to compress the request body. |

**Example**

```php
use Rubix\Server\HTTP\Middleware\Client\CompressRequestBody;
use Rubix\Server\HTTP\Encoders\Deflate;

$middleware = new CompressRequestBody(new Deflate(5));
```

### Shared Token Authenticator (Client Side)
Adds the necessary authorization headers to the request using the Bearer scheme.

#### Parameters
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | token | | string | The shared token to authenticate the request. |

**Example**

```php
use Rubix\Server\HTTP\Middleware\Client\SharedtokenAuthenticator;

$middleware = new SharedTokenAuthenticator('secret');
```

### FAQs
Here you will find answers to the most frequently asked questions.
#### How do I run the server?
All model servers are designed to be run from the PHP command line interface ([CLI](http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.php)). Model servers are long-running asynchronous processes that handle concurrent requests and implement their own networking stack avoiding the need for a third-party web server such as Nginx or Apache.

To run the server, you can execute your script containing the server code by entering the following on the command line.

```sh
$ php server.php
```

#### Can I run the model server on the same host as a regular web server?
Yes, model server are designed to coexist with other web servers (including other model servers) seamlessly. Just make sure that each server runs on its own unique port.

#### How do I scale inference throughput?
Since model servers are inference-only (i.e. they only support queries), they scale horizontally by adding more instances behind a load balancer such as [Nginx](http://nginx.org).

#### Do servers support compression?
Yes, the HTTP Server supports both Gzip and Deflate compression schemes applied to the request bodies. However, since response bodies tend to be considerably smaller compared to requests for this application, they do not support outbound message compression.
